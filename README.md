This repository has figures showing key results from my Ph.D. dissertation. 

Summary: The goal of the work was to understand the migration of planets in a planetary system. I simulated 240 planets and studied their migration behavior. For low mass planets, the migration is stochastic and can be characterized as a classical diffusion process. 
I propose a diffusion coefficient that can estimate the migration distance of a planet for the physical conditions used in the simulation. Details of the thesis can be found here: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PhDT.......119D
 
Background: It is actually a norm for planets to migrate, Jupiter and Saturn have migrated too from somewhere within the Solar System, and have achieved their current radial positions. 

Figure Descriptions: 
(A) Figure p240_001.jpeg shows the midplane density of the 3D model of the protoplanetary disk (grid: 512 (radial) by 512 (azimuthal) by 64 (vertical)). 
240 planets are embedded in the disk, each planet has a unique color. A set of 30 planets at each of the 8 azimuthal locations has the same marker-symbol. Three annuli are resonance regions for spiral density waves in the disk.

(B) Figure p240_end.jpeg shows the final distribution of planets in the disk, after about 3500 years.

(C) Figure bar_1_Mig_vs_initial_a.jpg show bar charts of the migration distances for all planets. 

(D) de_vs_a_da.jpg shows the change in planet eccentricities w.r.t. to planet semimajor axis.
